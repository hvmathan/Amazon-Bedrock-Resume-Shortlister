# Amazon-Bedrock-Resume-Shortlister

Recently, I came across a situation to fill a position for my team. The moment we opened the role, I received close to 300 resumes for evaluation. While our HR team did their best to manually sift through them based on job description, experience, skill set, and other factors... I realized:
Why not automate this using Generative AI?

And so, this product was born :)

What This Is About
This project explores how Generative AI (via Amazon Bedrock) can help HR teams:

Automatically screen resumes
Evaluate candidate fitment to job descriptions
Provide actionable insights
All in minutes, not days.
The Problem
Recruiters often face:

Hundreds of resumes per job posting
Time-consuming manual screening
Inconsistent and subjective evaluation
The Solution
With the power of Amazon Bedrock + Python + Streamlit, I built a Resume Shortlister that:

Takes resumes (.docx) as input
Evaluates them against a selected job description
Returns:
Match Score
Reasoning
Missing Skills
Tech Stack
Amazon Bedrock (Titan Text - Nova)
Python
Streamlit for UI
Matplotlib, WordCloud for analytics
Pandas for data handling
Boto3 for AWS integration
Folder Structure

Streamlit Demo (UI Preview)
Image description

Once the above command is run, it opens up the UI which has the below features :

Upload multiple resumes
Choose Job Role (Project Manager, Developer, Intern, etc.)
See Match Score, Reasoning, and Missing Skills
View charts
Image description

Suppose I'm hiring a Software Developer for my team ‚Äî I simply select the relevant role from the dropdown menu.

Image description

Next, I upload the resumes I‚Äôve received. For demonstration purposes, I‚Äôve included a mix of profiles to test whether Bedrock can accurately identify the most relevant candidates.

Image description

Bedrock now takes over and begins evaluating each profile.
If you're curious about what exactly we're sending to Bedrock, you can revisit the Python code ‚Äî The prompt is designed to be clear and structured. Bedrock then uses Amazon Titan (Nova) under the hood to evaluate the resume and return results.

Once the analysis is complete, we get a structured summary for each resume, including:

Match Score (out of 100)

Reasoning behind the score

Missing skills or experience compared to the job description

This gives instant clarity to recruiters on which candidates are worth shortlisting ‚Äî all without manually opening a single resume.

Image description

{
"score": 85,
"reasoning": [
"The resume demonstrates relevant experience as a project manager...",
"The candidate has 1 year of experience...",
"Highlights skills in team coordination..."
],
"missing": [
"No mention of JIRA",
"Education section lacks detail"
]
}

Finally, the system presents the Top 5 candidates ‚Äî each with a match score and clear reasoning ‚Äî making it incredibly easy for the HR team to not just identify qualified profiles, but to confidently select the best of the best.

Impact on HR Teams
Saves time and effort
Transparent and explainable results
Consistent, AI-assisted decision making
Shortlist ready-to-interview candidates faster
Final Thoughts
This project showcases how Generative AI combined with Amazon Nova can revolutionize Talent Acquisition and HR Analytics ‚Äî automating resume screening, improving decision-making, and saving hours of manual effort.

Whether you're an HR professional, a hiring manager, or an AI enthusiast, this is a glimpse into the future of intelligent hiring.
